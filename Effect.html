                    <h2 class="title-font text-2xl font-medium text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">The economic impact of the 2020
                        coronavirus pandemic in India has been largely disruptive. India's growth in the fourth quarter
                        of the fiscal year 2020 went down to 3.1% according to the Ministry of Statistics. The Chief
                        Economic Adviser to the Government of India said that this drop is mainly due to the coronavirus
                        pandemic effect on the Indian economy. Notably India had also been witnessing a pre-pandemic
                        slowdown, and according to the World Bank, the current pandemic has "magnified pre-existing
                        risks to India's economic outlook".

                        The World Bank and rating agencies had initially revised India's growth for FY2021 with the
                        lowest figures India has seen in three decades since India's economic liberalization in the
                        1990s. However, after the announcement of the economic package in mid-May, India's GDP estimates
                        were downgraded even more to negative figures, signalling a deep recession. (The ratings of over
                        30 countries have been downgraded during this period.) On 26 May, CRISIL announced that this
                        will perhaps be India's worst recession since independence. State Bank of India research
                        estimates a contraction of over 40% in the GDP in Q1 The contraction will not be uniform, rather
                        it will differ according to various parameters such as state and sector. On 1 September 2020,
                        the Ministry of Statistics released the GDP figures for Q1 (April to June) FY21, which showed a
                        contraction of 24% as compared to the same period the year before.</p>

                        been impacted as funding has fallen.Fast-moving consumer goods companies in the country
                        have significantly reduced operations and are focusing on essentials. Stock markets in India
                        posted their worst loses in history on 23 March 2020. However, on 25 March, one day after a

                        biggest gains in 11 years.</p>

                        The FTSE, Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nikkei all saw huge falls as the number of
                        Covid-19 cases grew.

                        The Dow and the FTSE saw their biggest quarterly drops in the first three months of the year

                        the UK, slashed interest rates. That should, in theory, make borrowing cheaper and encourage
                        spending to boost the economy.

                        Global markets have since recovered some ground as governments have intervened. But some
                        analysts have warned that they could be volatile until fears of a second wave of the pandemic
